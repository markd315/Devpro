The required downloads to run the game are the tex folder which must be in the same scope as the runnable jar.

The libraries and natives are extracted into the jar, so they're only listed here for open-source purposes.

Move the car with WASD (Gas, Left, Brake, Right respectively)

Set a cruise control with C.

Spawn new enemies with E.

Restart the game with N

Save and quit the game with ESC.

The game will create an error log when you do that last part. Ignore it, I didn't bother killing the OpenGL window in the preferred way.

The textures don't have good transparency with a white background because they were done in paint for a tech demonstration. Sorry.
